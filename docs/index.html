                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        
                        <p> The merger of binary BHs is a very
    complicated process that requires numerical simulations to accurately
    predict the outcome. These simulations are very expensive, taking about a
    month on a supercomputer to run. In recent years, several
    <em>surrogate</em> models for these simulations have been developed.  These
    models are trained against a large number of numerical simulations, using
    some fancy interpolation methods. In the end, the surrogate can reproduce
    the result of the simulation as accurately as the simulation itself, but in
    a fraction of a second, and on your laptop, rather than a month on a supercomputer!
                        </p>

                        <p> In our new package, <em>binaryBHexp</em>, we use these surrogate models to
    visualize the evolution of binary black hole systems. You can now generate
    visualizations at any point in the parameter space, in a few seconds,
    without needing to do a full numerical simulation! These visualizations are
    described in detail in our paper [<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06552">arXiv:1811.06552</a>].
                        </p>

                  <p>
                    On this page you'll find a number of example
                    explorations that highlight what you can learn
                    about black hole mergers
                    with <em>binaryBHexp</em>.  For quick access, use

                        <p> Here we see a precessing binary black hole merger.
    The black holes are shown as oblate spheres, with arrows indicating their
    spins. The orbital angular momentum is indicated by the pink arrow at the
    origin. The colors in the bottom-plane shows the value of the plus
    polarization of the GW as seen by an observer at that location; red means
    positive and blue means negative, notice the quadrupolar pattern of the
    radiation. In the subplot at the bottom, we show the plus and cross
    polarizations as seen from the camera viewing angle. Our time steps are
    chosen such that there are 30 frames per orbit during the
    inspiral-merger-ringdown; this ensures that the movie slows down near the
    merger, and it's easier to observe the dynamics. After the ringdown, we
    speed up the movie to exaggerate the kick.
                        </p>
                        <p> Here the BH spins are misaligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction. Therefore, the spins, the angular momentum, and the
    orbital plane all precess during the inspiral. It is interesting to see how
    the remnant spin direction is very close to the direction of the orbital
    angular momentum near merger. This animation corresponds to Fig. 1 of
    [<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06552">arXiv:1811.06552</a>].

                        <p> Here we show the same animation, but with a varying
    camera angle. In the plot at the bottom we see how the waveform changes
    based on the viewing angle; this is because the different (spin-weighted
    spherical harmonic) modes combine with different weights based on the
    observer viewing angle.  Notice how the GW signal is strongest along the
    direction of orbital angular momentum and weakest in perpendicular
    directions. This animation corresponds to Fig. 4 of [<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06552">arXiv:1811.06552</a>].

                        <p> Here the spins are aligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction, and there is no precession. Due to symmetries, the
    remnant spin is also aligned, while the remnant velocity is restricted to
    the orbital plane.

                        </video>

                        <p> Here we demonstrate the "orbital hangup effect". On
    the left, both black hole spins are aligned with the orbital angular
    momentum. In the middle, the black holes are nonspinning. On the right,
    both spins are anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum. All three
    cases start at the same orbital frequency, however, due to the orbital
    hangup-up effect, the aligned (anti-aligned) case takes a longer (shorter)
    time to merge than the nonspinning case. As a result the aligned system
    also loses more energy to gravitational waves, and the final mass is
    smaller. On the other hand, because the anti-aligned spins reduce the total
    orbital angular momentum of the system, the final spin is lesser in the
    right case. The nonspinning case is intermediate between these two.
                        </p>

                        <p> In these cases, due to the symmetries present, the
    final kick is zero.  Unlike the other animations in this page, here we use
    uniform time steps between movie frames. Even though the start frequency is
    the same, the length of the waveform is different in each case, and
    therefore the BHs merge at different times. This animation corresponds to
    Fig.  5 of [<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06552">arXiv:1811.06552</a>].

                        <h3 id="super_kick">Super-kick</h3>

                        <video width="450px" height="auto"  controls>
                            <source src="movies/super_kick.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
                        </video>

                        <p> In this case, notice how the spins line up in a
    single plane close to the merger. This is believed to be necessary to cause
    super-kicks, or very high remnant velocities. Notice how fast the final
    black hole flies away compared to the above cases; that is about c/100,
    where c is the speed of light! This is larger than the escape velocity of
    even the most massive galaxies in the Universe, and such a binary would get
    kicked out of its host galaxy. This animation corresponds to Fig. 6 of
    [<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06552">arXiv:1811.06552</a>].

                        </video>

                        <p> The kick velocity is very sensitive to the
    orientation of the component spins near merger. Here we show several cases
    that have equal-mass BHs, with anti-parallel spins lying in the orbital
    plane at t=−100M. Each evolution is initialized with a different orbital
    phase or, equivalently, performing an overall rotation of the spins about
    the z-axis. The remnant kick changes dramatically with the phase of the
    spins at merger; notice the sinusoidal nature of the final kick magnitude.

                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp -h

                        <h4>Examples</h4>

                        <p> You can generate this 
    <a href="#super_kick"> super-kick movie </a> with the following command:
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp --q 1.34 --chiA 0.62 -0.27 0.34 --chiB -0.62 0.27 0.34
</code></pre>

                        <p> You can generate this 
    <a href="#prec_bbh"> precessing movie </a> with the following command:
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp --q 2 --chiA 0.3 0.7 -0.1 --chiB 0.3 0.6 0.1 --omega_ref 1.8e-2
</code></pre>

                        <p> You can generate this 
    <a href="#prec_bbh_rotating_camera"> precessing movie with a varying
    camera angle </a> with the following command:
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp --q 2 --chiA 0.3 0.7 -0.1 --chiB 0.3 0.6 0.1 --omega_ref 1.8e-2 --auto_rotate_camera
</code></pre>

                        <p> You can save the video to file with the --save_file 
    option. Use this option if the live rendering is slow. You can generate
    this <a href="#aligned_bbh"> aligned-spin movie </a> with the following
    command:
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp --q 2 --chiA 0 0 -0.6 --chiB 0 0 0.8 --omega_ref 1.8e-2  --save_file aligned.mp4
